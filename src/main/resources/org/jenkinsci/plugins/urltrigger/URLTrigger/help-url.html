    <p>
        Give the url to check.<br/>
        You are able to give a template value (a value containing some environment variables to solve).<br/>
        By default, environment variables used by polling mechanism are supplied by the last build.<br/>
        For the first build, Jenkins tries to resolve the environment variables from the current polling node.<br/>
        <u>Be careful:</u> in the context of a previous build with no environment variables and a value with node or job
        environment variables, it is possible to have a build without a real URL change (due to a wrong URL check at
        Jenkins startup when all nodes are not up.)
